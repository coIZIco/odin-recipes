<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Growing up I loved lasagna, but my family rearely made it since it can be so difficult.</p>
    <p>Luckily I came across a super easy recipe and have made it my own over the years.</p>
    <p>This is so easy, you won't mind that your family will beg for it every Friday night.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Onion and Garlic</li>
        <li>Tomato Products</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Spices and Seasonings</li>
        <li>Lasagna Noodles</li>
        <li>Cheeses</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and gerlic in a Dutch oven until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
            Season with sugar, parsley, basil, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1.5 hours, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of slightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8-10 minues. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
            In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, parsley, and salt
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
        <li>
            To assemble, spread 1.5 cups of meat suace in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over the meat sauce.
            Spread with half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1.5 cups of meat sauce over the mozzarella, and sprinkle with parmesan cheese.
            Repeat layers, and top with mozzarella and parmesan cheese. Cover with foil (to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure it doesn't 
            touch the cheese).
        </li>
        <li>Baking in the oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
