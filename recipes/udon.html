<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Udon is one of my favorite types of noodles. It is just so thick and chewy.</p>
    <p>This recipe is prefect for udon since the sauce is nice and thick, it just sticks right to the noodles.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package of dried udon</li>
        <li>0.5 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1.5 tbs minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>3 tbs soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tbs peanut butter</li>
        <li>1.5 tbs honey</li>
        <li>2 tsp chili oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 whole rotisserie chicken, meat removed</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>0.25 cup chopped green onions</li>
        <li>0.25 cup chopped peanuts</li>
        <li>0.25 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring large pot with lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Drop the udon in a few noodles at a time and return to a boil.
            Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the udon has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, 10-12 minutes. 
            Drain and return to the pot.
        </li>
        <li>While the noodles are cooking, whisk the chicken broth, ginger, soy sauce, peanut butter, honey, chili oil, and garlic in a saucepan over medium-high heat.
            Bring to a boil, whisking until the peanut butter has melted. Pour the sauce over the noodles. Add the chicken and red bell pepper;
            toss until the noodles are evenly coated in the sauce. Sprinkle with green onions, chopped peanuts, and cilantro to serve.
